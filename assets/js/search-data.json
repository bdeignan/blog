            "content": "My inaugural post on here is a bit meta and probably unlike most things that I’ll write. . First, this blog is built with fastpages. If you’re like me and work with Jupyter notebooks all the time, then fastpages makes it a breeze to turn them into blog posts. There’s a whole lot more you can do with fastpages mentioned in the Twitter thread below. I love everything fast.ai does, and this tool is no exception. . We&#39;re launching `fastpages`, a platform which allows you to host a blog for free, with no ads. You can blog with @ProjectJupyter notebooks, @office Word, directly from @github&#39;s markdown editor, etc.Nothing to install, &amp; setup is automated!https://t.co/dNSA0oQUrN . &mdash; Jeremy #Masks4All Howard (@jeremyphoward) February 24, 2020 The problem: . Outside of this blog, I have a personal website and I wanted them to blend together as seamlessly as (a data scientist like me can make) possible. Namely, I wanted to link to an external “about me” page where I keep an updated resume to the “About” page of this fastpages blog. . Luckily, a fastpages GitHub issue addresses this very thing and one of the primary fastpages contributors already posted some helpful links there. . But I also like to see concrete examples. So, if you’re the same, then hopefully this helps. . The fix: . It’s a pretty simple fix. I removed the “about” markdown file from the /_posts directory and replaced it with an html file. This is what the new about.html file looks like: . title: About search_exclude: true &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;Redirecting to https://bdeignan.github.io/about&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0; URL=https://bdeignan.github.io/about&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://bdeignan.github.io/about&quot;&gt; . This pretty much follows one of the links provided in the issue’s comment. . The main thing you’ll want to change is the URL linked to. Substitute your page for https://bdeignan.github.io/about above. . And, voila. I pushed the changes to my blog’s repo and now “About” sends you to my personal site. . This lets me keep my blog separate from my personal site – in case I want to change things in the future to one of them. I find the fastpages blog setup so convenient for data science posts but I may want to change my personal site in the future if I get bored enough to learn some web development skills. This separation should help make those changes easier to maintain. .",
